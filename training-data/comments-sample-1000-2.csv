One suggestion for now is to add a 'bool generate_exited' parameter to SocketManager::close that only generates the exited events if true (the default).

This general pattern of ""closing"" the socket is still unfortunate, however, because it'll mean we may queue up some data to send (Encoders) that we then close even though the downgraded connection may work correctly. This could start to introduce some funky things in practice, as in, some messages actually look like they're getting dropped\! So the real way to fix this is to probably grab the SocketManager mutex and actually update all of the data structures with the ""new"" socket.

Thanks a lot for rebasing on top of those 3 new JIRAs.

If you don't mind I feel like there are three JIRAs in here still :)

1. netty optimization #1 shortcircuit to local doRequest() calls
2. netty optimization #2 connection pools
3. bandwidth tracking

I would like to extract two of them and leave one behind as GIRAPH-262 (so it would be 1. (netty optimization #1))

The reason I'm being so picky about it is that I've modified a lot of the same code in my GIRAPH-211 patch. So I want to carefully merge your enhancements into there. 


I am happy to extract 2 and 3 out today as I did yesterday for GIRAPH-280-282, if you don't mind kindly rebasing your patch on them.

Thanks for posting this review.

From an elasticsearch HTTP client perspective, the patch looks good.

However, in your patch, the only class that implements ElasticSearchIdProvider is ElasticSearchNullIdProvider and it returns a null id which means ES is still going to have to generate one when the document is indexed.

Based on the description of the patch reviewed, it would have been nice to see another example class that implements ElasticSearchIdProvider that actually generates a non-null document id so that this default behavior can be overriden.

So maybe generating a document id based on the original timestamp in the event optionally in combination of other headers would be nice.

Nevertheless, this is a good effort.

Thanks.",true,

Rather, we always recover the allocator, but in certain cases recovery might do different things. Still, not sure that we want to have the differing behavior depending on whether quota is set. For example, we could do the following:

```
void HierarchicalAllocatorProcess::recover(
    const registry::Slaves& slaves,
    const hashmap<string, Quota>& quotas)
{
  CHECK_EQ(INITIALIZED, state);
 
  recoveredSlaveCount = slaves.slaves().size();
 
  foreachpair (const string& role, const Quota& quota, quotas) {
    setQuota(role, quota.info);
  }
  
  // We'll start allocating once a sufficient percentage
  // of agents re-register (or the timeout elapses) to
  // avoid acting on partial state (which can lead to
  // a number of issues!).
  
  Duration recoveryTimeout = ALLOCATOR_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT;
 
  LOG(INFO) << ""Allocation will start within "" << recoveryTimeout
            << "" once "" << ALLOCATOR_RECOVERY_AGENT_THRESHOLD_PERCENT << ""%""
            << "" of the "" << slaves.slaves().size()
            << "" recovered slaves re-register"";

  delay(recoveryTimeout, self(), &Self::_recover);

  state = RECOVERING;
}
```

We'll need to either check the threshold condition in addSlave (as is currently done) to trigger the completion of recovery, have some abstraction that satisfies a future when a threshold is met. The latter is tricky if we want to finish recovery when slaves.size() reaches the threshold (gauge-like abstraction but we have to know when to check the gauge) rather than when the count of addSlave calls reaches the threshold (counter-like abstraction, easier).",true,

I really don't want to be deal with adding `string` and `const char []`
overloads everywhere. Ideally, we'd have a `string_view` class that we
could use instead of `string` here.

Now, as far as performance goes, there are a couple of things to note.
  (1) It seems like the claim is that it speeds up the tests? by how much?
  (2) The claim that we avoid an unnecessary allocation isn't actually
      true considering that the strings (at least in our tests) probably
      fit within the short-string optimization.
  (3) Is this change by itself a big win somewhere? or will it require
      a systematic change where `string` can be a `string_view`?
      If the former, I'd be fine with optimizing these functions, but
      if it's the former, I'd say we should invest in a `string_view` class.

I quite like performance, but some more evidence would be helpful here.

Now, under the assumption that the performance argument to be justified,
we can simply make the existing function a template and generalize the logic:

```cpp
template <typename Stringish>
bool startsWith(const string& s, const Stringish& prefix) {
  return s.size() >= distance(begin(prefix), end(prefix)) &&
         equal(begin(prefix), end(prefix), begin(s));

There is an argument to say this is unnnecessarily find grained, but it's a lot easier to start off with this approach and then consolidate down the line than the other way as it makes us focus very clearly on any interdependencies. Generally an OMAS implemention should be dependent only on the connector framework, having a valid OMRS implementation accessible, a messaging infrastructure, but shouldn;t assume other things like having access to other local classes in atlas without explicitly including or putting into a common component. Does that make sense?

1632,shindig,jcian,4085,9184,4104,9244,ReplyDiffComment,jcian,2011-12-23T12:45:26Z,"Yeah -- it ends up getting used further down the line during osapi.container.GadgetHolder.prototype.render -- specifically in osapi.container.GadgetHolder.prototype.getIframeUrl_ (line 346 -- 348).

Although I just noticed something else interesting that I hadn't noticed before -- it looks like the original authors of CC are actually already using the siteId as the moduleId...  They just (apparently) forgot to also use it in the security tokens.

If you look at lines 350 and 351 in gadget_holder.js you'll see that the siteId is used as the 'mid' parameter in the iframe url -- which means that the gadgets JS API code that deals with moduleId's will end up using the siteId as the moduleId (because the gadgets JS API parses the moduleId from the 'mid' parameter in the iframe url).  However as we've been discussing the moduleId in the security token gets set to 0 -- so anything on the server side that pulls the moduleId from the security token will get the wrong value.

You can actually see all this play out right now in shindig head by messing around with the common container sample page and adding a few gadgets.  To see what I'm taking about -- using shindig head -- browse to the CC sample container, add the todo and horoscope gadgets (to use up a couple of siteId's) and then add the activities stream sample (to get a gadget that needs a security token) -- then using firefox right click the whitespace in the activities gadget and load it into its own tab (so you can easily see the requests it makes in firebug and execute code against the gadgets API in the context of that gadget).  Then -- if you reload that tab, watch in firebug and look at the security token passed with the soacial API calls -- you'll see the moduleId in it is 0 -- but if you execute this code in the console:

var prefs = new gadgets.Prefs();
console.log(prefs.getModuleId());

You'll get back 'gadget-site-2'

So I guess this gives some precedent for using the siteId as the moduleId.  As I've said before I personally think this would work out fine (using siteId as moduleId) and might be worth trying to start with and then changing later if we run into issues -- but in the end I dont think it makes much difference to me.  There's also precedent for something similar elsewhere too (in both igoogle and rave and likely other places as well).  If you look at igoogle for example you'll see that they wrap all their gadgets in a div which includes their moduleId (and in CC we use that wrapper div ID as the siteId).  Ryan and I had a discussion on this a while back which might be worth looking over again -- here is the relevant piece:

56052,mesos,greggomann,164960,236798,165191,237008,ReplyDiffComment,greggomann,2017-02-10T22:40:14Z,"Yea it looks like k8s solves this by always base64-encoding the secret data. Since k8s provides its own secret-store, they can establish this constraint easily. In our case, if we want to support arbitrary back-ends, we can't necessarily make this assumption. For example, see the API section of the docs for the Hashicorp Vault PKI backend: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/pki/. Some of these endpoints return raw binary data. If we require that a secret fetcher module be used to populate REFERENCE type secrets, then we could still require base64-encoding, and the secret fetcher could be responsible for encoding fetched secrets appropriately.

Let's consider a concrete example: a cluster using a Hashicorp Vault secret store which has two back-ends loaded: 'generic' (the default) and 'pki'. Given the current `Secret` design in this patch, a fetcher module could infer the correct back-end to use via the `reference.name`. For example, the module could map these names directly onto the Vault API: a name of '/pki/ca' would grab the PKI back-end's CA, and a name of '/pki/cert/<serial#>' could grab a particular certificate from the PKI back-end. A name of '/generic/my_secret' could fetch the secret named ""my_secret"" in the generic back-end.

In any case, if we wanted to mandate only base64-encoded secrets within Mesos, the secret fetcher could be aware of the type of data received from the back-end's API and encode it appropriately, if necessary. Or, we could allow binary secrets and include explicit type information to distinguish between text and binary. If we do this, however, it's not clear to me that the user launching a task should need to specify whether the secret is text or bytes - perhaps the secret fetcher could determine this from a particular secret name, or perhaps some secret stores may return both text and binary secrets from the same API call? I'm not sure, need to do some more research.

If we want to provide a more generic HTTP-based secret-fetching model in which a user could specify an arbitrary endpoint that would return the desired secret, then it makes sense for that user to specify text vs. bytes. However, in that case it's not clear to me where the generic fetcher gets the credentials needed to fetch the secret itself.

This brings me to another important issue regarding secret fetching: how does the fetcher establish that the executor or task in question is authorized to fetch the specified secret? With this proto, we're attempting to provide a first-class object permitting the secure fetching of secrets; do we also want to provide a first-class identity associated with the executor/task for the purpose of authorizing the secret-fetching?",true,

I don't think we want to remove those operations just yet. I think we should remove those operations only if the corresponding RP has re-registered with the agent and show up in the offer operation list (or total resources).

This is similar to we don't remove tasks when agent disconnects. In fact, you should follow the similar patter in reconcileKnownSlave here. If an operation is unknown, instead of calling `removeOfferOperation` directly, we should probably send a `reconcileOfferOperationMessage` to the agent to ask the RP to generate a status update, and rely on status update handler to properly handle the resource accounting.

Also realized that we probably should also do the same in the agent code. Instead of directly calling removeOfferOperation and addOfferOperation, send a `RECONCILE` message to RP to asking the RP to generate a status udpate. If it's unknown to the RP, RP will send OFFER_OPERATION_DROPPED, which is terminal.",true,

The default behavior (if no RequestFilter was bound) would be that no filtering is done.  A basic version of the RequestFilter can be provided, but it would be essentially returning true.   With the optional injection and the check for null, it would not actually be required.

I did originally do this as an injection via the constructor and found that it rippled a bit requiring changes in test cases as they explicitly invoked the constructor.  Since this was optional, I found that using the method injection seemed a bit cleaner for the code.   Either way, the change to the fetch method was the same. 

I considered just adding isRequestAllowed() as a method to the BasicHttpFetcher, but wanting to change the behavior would have required a subclass and still required a Guice binding to be done, so this seemed cleaner.

And there is an exists method on operations, which is completely pointless with the checked exceptions. Consider the following code snippets:

// Can write this if TableNamespaceExistsException is Runtime

  namespaceOperations.create(""foo"")

// If it is checked, then you have to write
if (! namespaceOperations.exists(""foo"")) {
  try {

Now, my preferred snippet (#1) _is_ susceptible to a potential race condition, but I think the solution is a more serious API redesign.

I'm wondering about the `Note` regarding only setting the scheduling policy to IDLE if the initial resources are revocable. I think this exposes many scenarios where the isolator will seem `enabled` to the operator, but won't actually be isolating correctly.
I don't think it is uncommon to launch an executor with non-revocable resources, and then later launch BE tasks with revocable resources. This pattern would always lead to the isolator being in-effective right?

I am not super familiar with the rules around the isolators, but why can we not adjust the policy within the update() call as opposed to in the isolate() function?",,

All I'm saying whenever we saw this message in practice, it's not because aggregators part is slow, but because some of the workers is being slow doing the computation / processing message requests. It's not just about the cases when there are 0 aggregators, in majority of situations you'll have just one/several aggregator requests - this always get transferred instantly (compare it to thousands of message requests which we are sending in each of our applications).

We can't just say skip this part (unless we add a special option which user needs to turn on in order to use aggregators - but I don't think we want to do that), since workers need to know somehow whether there are aggregators in the application or not. So we'd need to have zookeeper involved in one code path, and current solution in the other. And as discussed many times before, I don't see the benefit of doing so since there is basically no overhead of current approach. ",,

We also never nest a group lock inside the metadataLock, so we don't get circular waits between group locks and the metadataLock.

ZkClient doesn't cause any circular waits because internally, it just puts all ZkEvents into a queue and has a dedicated thread processing each event's corresponding TopicPartitionChangeListener handleDataChange or handleDataDeleted callbacks one by one, and these callbacks adhere to the locking patterns above.

I don't like making the code more complicated without some evidence that it will have a measurable impact, particularly with code that is already quite dense and subtle such as this. Do we have more than just conjecture in this case, e.g. is this a well known technique, or have we measured the effect?

It's plausible to suggest that the benefit of this change may be limited since the resizing heuristics that control the load factor of the map will be working against the likelyhood of it ever triggering. I also suspect that soft deletes along with amortized rehashing would yield a much better optimization and render this one all but inert.",,

At first I thought maybe you didn't want to do it that way because you didn't want to add the task state summaries into the Slave model (that gets shown in 'state.json'), but you add it to the Framework model (since 'model(const Framework& framework)' calls 'summarize') which I think is totally fine, so let's just be consistent and do the same thing with the slave. There is really nice symmetry there then too, we call 'summarize' for both the slave and the framework, which makes this code easier to grok.

FYI, I'd even be okay with 'state.json' including the 'framework_ids' and 'slave_ids' additional fields because they just ""came"" from summarize. But I'm also okay with keeping those as 'state-summary' specific additions.",,
